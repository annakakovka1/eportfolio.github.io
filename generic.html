              <h1>Deciphering Big Data</h1>
            </header>

            <p>In a world overflowing with information, Big Data holds the key to understanding patterns that drive innovation, decision-making, and growth. The true challenge lies not in collecting data, but in deciphering it — transforming vast, unstructured information into meaningful insights. My journey in exploring Big Data focuses on bridging the gap between complexity and clarity, leveraging analytics, visualisation, and critical thinking to reveal stories hidden within the numbers.</p>

            <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Show a comprehensive understanding of the core principles and signature features of Big Data as they manifest in Data Science.</li>
              <li>Use a combination of data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing methods to transform messy datasets into a truly usable format.</li>
              <li>Deploy analytical and machine-learning approaches like a comb across the data, lifting out the faint, almost hidden patterns and the gems of insight they hold.</li>
              <li>Create data visualisations that clearly present complex findings with precision.</li>
              <li>Evaluate issues surrounding data ethics, privacy considerations and governance structures that pop up across the sprawling landscape of big-data environments.</li>
              <li>Interlace findings with data-driven solutions, giving decision-makers a solid foundation for informed choices across a kaleidoscope of contexts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <p>Despite these benefits, Huxley et al. (2020) remind us that large-scale data collection comes with serious challenges. IoT devices generate massive amounts of data in different formats, which often makes it hard to clean, integrate and interpret effectively (Mansouri et al., 2021). Security and privacy risks are also significant — billions of connected devices increase the chances of data breaches and misuse of personal information (Tawalbeh et al., 2020).</p>
            <p>To manage these risks, frameworks such as the NIST IoT Security Baseline (Fagan et al., 2020) and the UK ICO’s IoT guidance (ICO, 2025) stress the importance of encryption, privacy-by-design, and limiting unnecessary data collection.</p>
            <p>Overall, while IoT offers great opportunities for innovation and smarter systems, it must be developed responsibly. Balancing the benefits of data-driven insights with strong governance and ethical oversight is key to making IoT a trustworthy and sustainable technology.</p>

            <h3>Activities</h3>

            <h4>Web Scraping “Data Scientist” Jobs with Python</h4>
            <p>This Python script demonstrates how to use Requests and BeautifulSoup4 to scrape job postings containing the keyword “Data Scientist”. It fetches data from a tutorial-safe website (<a href="https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/">Fake Jobs Demo Page</a>) and saves it as a JSON file.</p>

<pre><code># scrape_data_scientist_jobs.py
"""
Scrape job postings containing 'Data Scientist' and save them to a JSON file.
Uses Requests for HTTP and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML.
"""

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import json
import time

# 1. Identify the webpage (safe demo site)
URL = "https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/"
KEYWORD = "Data Scientist"
# 2. Send HTTP request
response = requests.get(URL)
response.raise_for_status()  # ensure successful request

# 3. Parse HTML with BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
# 4. Extract relevant data
jobs = []
for job_card in soup.find_all("div", class_="card-content"):
    title = job_card.find("h2", class_="title").get_text(strip=True)
    if KEYWORD.lower() in title.lower():
        company = job_card.find("h3", class_="company").get_text(strip=True)
        location = job_card.find("p", class_="location").get_text(strip=True)
        link = job_card.find_next("a", string="Apply")["href"]
        jobs.append({
            "title": title,
            "company": company,
            "location": location,
            "apply_url": link,
            "keyword": KEYWORD,
            "scraped_at": time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", time.gmtime())
        })
# 5. Store data in JSON format
output_file = "data_scientist_jobs.json"
with open(output_file, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    json.dump(jobs, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)

print(f"✅ Scraped {len(jobs)} '{KEYWORD}' job(s). Data saved to {output_file}.")
</code></pre>

            <p><em>Note:</em> This example uses a public tutorial site. Always check a site’s <code>robots.txt</code> file and terms of service before scraping.</p>

            <h4>Summary of findings</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>I used <code>requests</code> to fetch an HTML page and <code>BeautifulSoup</code> to parse job listings containing the keyword “Data Scientist”.</li>
              <li>The extracted data — including title, company, location, and apply link — were saved as a <code>JSON</code> file.</li>
              <li>The process followed the Request → Protocol → Response pattern of inter-process communication.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Critical reflection</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The main challenge was ensuring reliability and respecting ethical scraping rules.</li>
              <li>I used a static demo site (safe to scrape) to avoid legal or security issues.</li>
              <li>Data wrangling challenges include cleaning inconsistent data, changing page structures, and network errors.</li>
              <li>Using structured formats like JSON facilitates interoperability and data sharing.</li>
              <li>In a team context, proper task separation (developer, tester, analyst) and documentation are essential for maintainability and reproducibility.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Part 2 – Reflection (≈1,000 words)</h3>

            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>This reflection employs Rolfe et al.’s (2001) model What? So what? Now what? to analyse learning and development during the MedicaidUK database project. It focuses on technical competence, teamwork, and professional growth achieved through engagement with the data-wrangling module.</p>

            <h4>What?</h4>
            <p>The project objective was to design a secure and scalable database for MedicaidUK. My individual responsibilities included logical schema creation, validation of entity relationships, and documentation of compliance mechanisms. I contributed to the initial design proposal, developed entity attributes, and assisted in implementing schema components within MySQL.</p>
            <p>Engagement in data-wrangling activities involved extracting datasets from simulated sources, cleaning inconsistent records, and testing validation rules. I applied techniques such as deduplication, type standardisation, and referential checks to ensure data reliability.</p>
            <p>The collaborative aspect was equally significant. Regular virtual meetings allowed for reviewing schema consistency and resolving design conflicts. These sessions required concise technical communication and collective decision-making to achieve consensus on entity structures and naming conventions.</p>

            <h4>So What?</h4>
            <p>Working on this project clarified how abstract data-modelling theory operates within practical system design. Converting conceptual models into executable SQL schemas exposed challenges in maintaining referential integrity, enforcing constraints, and balancing normalisation with query efficiency. The iterative process revealed that even minor design inconsistencies can have cascading effects on functionality and reporting accuracy.</p>
            <p>A deeper understanding of ethical and legal dimensions of data management also emerged. Implementing access-control layers and encryption concepts provided insight into how technical design upholds confidentiality and trust. Marquis (2024) emphasised the preventive function of role-based access control, a principle integrated into the final schema.</p>
            <p>On a personal level, initial frustration over syntax errors and design revisions gradually transformed into appreciation for precision and structured problem-solving. The experience emphasised perseverance and collaboration as essential professional attributes. Feedback from peers and tutors promoted reflective practice and critical thinking, shifting focus from merely completing tasks to evaluating decisions in relation to best practice and research evidence.</p>
            <p>The emotional and cognitive engagement throughout the project strengthened confidence in handling complexity and communicating rationale to non-technical audiences. It highlighted that effective database design is not solely a technical exercise but also a process of reasoning, negotiation, and accountability.</p>

            <h4>Now What?</h4>
            <p>The knowledge gained from this project provides a foundation for future professional advancement. Continued development will focus on extending expertise in cloud-based database management, data-pipeline automation, and advanced analytics. The integration of predictive modelling and machine-learning techniques, as discussed by Na et al. (2023), represents a logical progression for applying these competencies to enhance healthcare operations.</p>
            <p>Further training in cybersecurity and data-protection frameworks will strengthen capacity to design and audit compliant systems. Participation in industry certifications related to data governance or privacy will consolidate the theoretical and practical learning achieved in this module.</p>
            <p>From a collaborative perspective, I will apply lessons learned about team coordination and communication in future projects. Establishing clearer task allocation, documentation standards, and version control will improve efficiency and reduce conflict in distributed teams.</p>

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>In summary, this reflective process has affirmed the importance of ongoing learning and ethical responsibility in data-focused professions. The MedicaidUK project turned theoretical knowledge into practical skill, aligning technical expertise with professional integrity and flexibility. The insights gained will inform future contributions to data management projects that require analytical accuracy, compliance awareness, and interdisciplinary teamwork.</p>
